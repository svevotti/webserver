tests with curl

GET request

curl -v http://localhost:8080 (homepage)--> 200
curl -v http://localhost:8080/about (about page) -->200
curl -v http://localhost:8080/uploads (static upload page) -->200
curl -v http://localhost:8080/ciao (404 not found page) -->404
curl -v -L http://localhost:8080/old-page (redirection, should see 301 first and then 200). in the configuration need to write "/" as redirect (not /static as it is now)

curl -v -o downloaded_image.jpg http://localhost:8080/upload/image.jpg (should see downloaded_image in webserver folder)
curl -v -o downloaded_image.jpg http://localhost:8080/upload/image.jpg (if image.jpg doesn't exist, not found I guess)

POST request (static)
curl -v -X POST -F "file=@./image.jpg" http://localhost:8080/upload (success)
curl -v -X POST -F "file=@./image.jpg" http://localhost:8080/upload (if already store it, it should be conflict)
curl -v -X POST -F "file=@./image.jpg" http://localhost:8080 (fail)

DELETE request
curl -v -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/upload/image.jpg (success)
curl -v -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/upload/image.jpg (after success, not found)
curl -v -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/uploads/index.html (failure)

you can also test on the web browser
http://localhost:8080 and then click on the pages (only the one we know provides a static page/static upload)

siege -c255 -t1m http://localhost:8080 --> availability 99.4++ and failure possibly zero
255 is the max to test with siege by default. it can increase in the siege configuration file\
while doing siege, you should try to perform other requests.
