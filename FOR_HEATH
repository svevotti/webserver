I have handled signals. 

I have also caught many leaks but there are still some.

Two I am aware of:

1. In ServerSocket (missing destructor, missing freeaddressinfo on socket failuers, missing close fds )

2. A cgi related issue: In either checkTime or checkCGITimeout // there is an edge case I still have to catch 
// the issue comes up when you run the infinite loop script in terminal and try to do a cgi request on browser at the same time
// and boils down to something going wrong in one of the check time functions in these cases

3. Something around multi-part requests and boundaries in HttpRequest causes leaks 
..this issue cones up when for instance you try to upload (dynamically) a file named Note_Apr12

Feel free to touch the code as you see fit. Just save a copy to be safe.
